The algorithm used for the MOD16 data product collection is based on the logic of the Penman-Monteith equation, which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with MODIS remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics, albedo, and land cover.\r\n\r\nProvided in the MOD16A2 product are layers for composited Evapotranspiration (ET), Latent Heat Flux (LE), Potential ET (PET) and Potential LE (PLE) along with a quality control layer. Two low resolution browse images are also available for each MOD16A2 granule, (1) ET and (2) LE.\r\n\r\nThe pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET & PET) are the sum of all eight days within the composite period and the pixel values for the two Latent Heat layers (LE & PLE) are the average of all eight days within the composite period. Note that the last 8-day period of each year is a 5 or 6-day composite period, depending on the year.\r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\nSpatial resolution of Version 6 products increased to nominal 500 meters from nominal 1,000 meters in Version 5.\r\n\r\nVersion 5 data products were previously distributed by the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group at the University of Montana. The Version 6 products are a continuation of this project.\r\n\r\nOperational Version 6 data products have had additional cloud/aerosol screening applied for the end of the year in which the previous full year of MODIS Leaf Area Index/FPAR (MOD15A2H) and Albedo (MCD43A3) data are available. See Section 3.2.1 of the User Guide for more information.\r\n","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile
