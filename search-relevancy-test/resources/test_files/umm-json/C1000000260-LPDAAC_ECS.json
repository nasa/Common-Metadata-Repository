SRTM was the primary (and virtually only) payload on the STS-99 mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which launched February 11, 2000 and ﬂew for 11 days.\n\nThe SRTM swaths extended from ~30 degrees off-nadir to ~58 degrees off-nadir from an altitude of 233 km, creating swaths ~225 km wide, and consisted of all land between 56 degrees south and 60 degrees north latitude to account for 80% of Earth’s total landmass. \n\nThe Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) is responsible for the archive and distribution of NASA MEaSUREs SRTM, which includes the global one-arc-second (~30 m) number product.\n\n------------------------------------ \nData Set Characteristics: \nGeographic Extent: Global between 60° North and 56° South latitude \nScene Coverage: 1° x 1° tiles \nImage Dimensions: 3601 x 3601 \nTotal Number Tiles: 12,677\nTile Volume: 3 GB \nCompression Type: zip \nFile Format: Zip, NUM\nMap Projection: Geographic latitude and longitude\nDatum: WGS84/EGM96 \nPixel Size: 1 arc second","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/SRTM/SRTMGL1N.003"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/datasets#utf8=%E2%9C%93&new_view=true&spatial_map=satellite&spatial_type=rectangle&keywords=SRTMGL1N"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to available LP DAAC products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"http://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/SRTM/SRTMGL1N.003/2000.02.11/"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Global Data Explorer (GDEX) provides user the ability to graphically select an area, and download topographic data.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","URL":"http://gdex.cr.usgs.gov/"},{"Description":"\n         USGS EarthExplorer (EE) provides users the ability to query, search and order archived products available from the LP DAAC.
