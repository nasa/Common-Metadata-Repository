The algorithm chooses the “best” pixel available from all the acquisitions of both MODIS sensors located on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites from within the 8-day period. LAI is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies and as one-half the total needle surface area per unit ground area in coniferous canopies.  FPAR is defined as the fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation (400-700nm) absorbed by the green elements of a vegetation canopy.The LAI product has attained stage 2 validation and the FPAR product has attained stage 1 Validation.","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aquaTerra&ver=C6"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD15A2H.006"},{"Description":"         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.
