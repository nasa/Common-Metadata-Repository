Low-level data are corrected for atmospheric gases and aerosols, yielding a level-2 basis for several higher-order gridded level-2 (L2G) and level-3 products.\r\n\r\nMOD09Q1 provides Bands 1 and 2 at 250-meter resolution in an 8-day gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. Each MOD09Q1 pixel contains the best possible L2G observation during an 8-day period as selected on the basis of high-observation coverage, low-view angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol loading. Science Data Sets provided for this product include reflectance values for Bands 1 and 2, and a quality rating.\r\n\r\nVersion-5 MODIS/Terra Surface Reflectance products are Validated Stage 2, meaning that accuracy has been assessed over a widely distributed set of locations and time periods via several ground-truth and validation efforts. \r\n\r\nChange Points of Interest\r\n\r\nReduced file volume: internal compression\r\nImproved aerosol retrieval\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nTemporal Coverage: February 18, 2000 - March 29, 2017\r\nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \r\nFile Size: ~72 MB compressed \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nImage Dimensions: 4800 x 4800 rows/columns \r\nResolution: 250 meters \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 3","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/293"},{"Description":"\n         Interface for discovering, accessing, and invoking EOS data products and services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to download to all currently available MODIS products by HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool/"},{"Description":"\n         The MODIS Reprojection Tool on the Web is available for selected MODIS land product tiles.
