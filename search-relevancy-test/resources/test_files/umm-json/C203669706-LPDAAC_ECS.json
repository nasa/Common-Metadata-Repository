The data product includes information about Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Net Photosynthesis (PSN).  The PSN band values are the GPP minus the Maintenance Respiration (MR). The data product also contains a PSN Quality Control layer. The quality layer contains quality information for both the GPP and the PSN.  Stage 3 validation has been achieved for MOD17 products.","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aqua&ver=C6"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD17A2H.006"},{"Description":"         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.
