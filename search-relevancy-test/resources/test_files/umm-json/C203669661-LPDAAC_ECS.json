The pixel temperature value is derived from the MYD11_L2 swath product.  Above 30 degrees latitude, some pixels may have multiple observations where the criteria for clear-sky are met. When this occurs, the pixel value is a result of the average of all qualifying observations.  Provided along with both the day- and night-time surface temperature bands and their quality indicator layers, are MODIS bands 31 and 32 and six observation layers.  Validation at stage 2 has been achieved for all MODIS LST/Emissivity products.","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aqua&ver=C6"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD11A1.006"},{"Description":"         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.
