The MOD14A2 file in HDF format consists of 2 Science Dataset (SDS) layers, a Fire Mask, and associated quality information.\r\n \r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\n•\tRefinements to internal cloud mask, which sometimes flags heavy smoke as clouds\r\n•\tFix for frequent false alarms in the Amazon that are caused by small (~1 km2) clearings within forests\r\n•\tFix to correct a bug that causes incorrect assessment of cloud and water pixels adjacent to fire pixels near the scan edge\r\n•\tDetect small fires using dynamic thresholding\r\n•\tProcess ocean and coastline pixels to detect fire from oil rigs\r\n•\tThe Version 6 Fire Mask has the potential to detect fire over water pixels. Therefore, class 3 pixel values have been changed to be classified as “non-fire water pixels.”\r\n","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS
