;; This top level project file is used to provide a single place to run lein tasks against all of
;; the CMR libraries and applications. It makes use of lein-modules to accomplish the orchestration.
;; See https://github.com/jcrossley3/lein-modules for details.
;;
;; Examples:
;; 'lein modules clean' will run lein clean in every project subdirectory.
;; 'lein modules install' will run lein install in every project subdirectory. Lein-modules will
;; make sure to build the libraries and applications in the correct order based on the individual
;; project dependencies.
;; 'lein with-profile uberjar modules uberjar' will build uberjars for all of the CMR applications
;; listed in the uberjar profile.
;; 'CMR_ELASTIC_PORT=9206 lein modules do clean, install, test-out' will set the elastic port to use
;; as an environment variable, run clean in all project subdirectories, install in all project
;; subdirectories, and then test-out in all project subdirectories.
