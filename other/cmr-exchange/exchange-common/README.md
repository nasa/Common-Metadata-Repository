## About

This repo just contains functions and components common to most of the other
projects in cmr-exchange. The name `cmr-common` was deliberately avoided, since
that is currently used in the legacy CMR codebase which the cmr-exchange
projects support (and which which they interoperate).


## Dependencies [&#x219F;](#contents)

* Java
* `lein`
