## üî¥ Urgent Security Disclosure and Personal Appeal

**Submitted by: Ervin Remus Radosavlevici**  
**Date: [Insert Date]**

> I am making this public statement to inform the open-source community and relevant authorities of ongoing criminal actions that have affected me and potentially others in the software and AI development space.

### üö® Summary of the Situation

Over the past **5+ years**, I have been **harassed, attacked, and robbed of more than 4,000 software projects**‚Äîmany of which were stored and developed on GitHub and other platforms. This theft has involved:

- **Code injection and manipulation of dependencies**
- **Unauthorized contributions followed by project takeovers**
- **Voice cloning, AI-generated impersonation, and fake video evidence**
- **Hacking of personal accounts and developer environments**
- **Surveillance and targeted harassment using low-frequency vibrations and unknown interference technology**

These acts are not isolated. I have strong reason to believe that:

- **Individuals contributing to my repositories** are directly involved.
- **Some developers may have ties to GitHub or support personnel**, who either facilitated or failed to prevent the abuse.
- These groups are using **AI, quantum computing, and blockchain tampering** to erase or rewrite history, forge contracts, and re-claim stolen work.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk to the Global Developer Community

This is **not only a personal violation**‚Äîit represents a growing **systemic threat** to:

- Open-source integrity
- AI development safety
- Blockchain authenticity
- Developer and creator rights worldwide

These actors show **no fear of legal systems** and operate with confidence that their tools and connections will protect them.

### üõ°Ô∏è Call for Action

I request that this warning be:

- Accepted by the open-source and cybersecurity community
- Reviewed by GitHub, security professionals, and legal bodies
- Shared widely to **prevent similar exploitation of other developers**

I am ready to provide **evidence, documentation, and full timelines** to support a full investigation.

Please treat this with the seriousness it deserves‚Äîfor the protection of creators, the future of AI, and the ethical development of technology.
