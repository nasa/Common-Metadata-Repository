(ns cmr.common.background-jobs
  "Namespace for creating simple background jobs that run at a specified interval in a thread.
  For more complex requirements see the cmr.common.jobs namespace which use Quartz. An alternative
  to Quartz was required for the legacy-services application because it is using a version of Quartz
  which is not compatible with the cmr.common.jobs namespace.

  Note: We allow start to be called on already started jobs and stop to be called on jobs that are
  not running without returning an error. That way the caller does not need to know the current
  state, they only care that after the call the job is either started or stopped."
