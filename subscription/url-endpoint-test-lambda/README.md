url-endpoint-test-lambda function is a test lambda meant to test subscriptions with a URL endpoint. 
The test lambda will run in SIT and WL and it provides an endpoint that testers can use to test URL endpoint based subscriptions. 

A user creates an ingest granule subscription. An example follows:
{"Name": "Ingest-Subscription-Test-Sit-http",
 "Type": "granule",
 "SubscriberId": "user1",
 "CollectionConceptId": "C1200463968-CMR_ONLY",
 "EndPoint": "http://<the-internal-loadbalancer-url>/notification/tester",
 "Mode": ["New", "Update", "Delete"],
 "Method": "ingest",
 "MetadataSpecification": {
   "URL": "https://cdn.earthdata.nasa.gov/umm/subscription/v1.1.1",
   "Name": "UMM-Sub",
   "Version": "1.1.1"
 }
}

Make sure the URL is the CMR internal load balancer followed by /notification/tester.

Ingest a granule. 

To verify that the notification is correct and that it was sent through the tunnel into the CMR internal load balancer,
issue a get request to the load balancer with the correct tunnel port number such as

curl http://localhost:8081/notification/tester

The contents of the notification will be sent back to the caller and can then be verified.

To send a test notification to the test tool send a post request. An example follows:

curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8081/notification/tester -d '{
