  ;; XXX This is really awful, and we do it a lot in the CMR. What we've got
  ;;     as a result of this is a leak from implementation into a separate part
  ;;     of the code ... not to mention that whatever is happing is is 100%
  ;;     implicit and chock-a-block with side effects. I believe the reason we
  ;;     do this is to work around issues with multimethods. We really need to
  ;;     refactor our multimethod code -- and this isn't the only reason
  ;;     (multimethods use slower code under the hood). If we really do need
  ;;     the flexible polymorphism that multimethods provide, then let's
  ;;     rethink our code reuse strategy around multimethods.
